# VR-AR-walking-visualization
This is a VR-AR-visualization for school project. Testing if you could see or use this as a map. 

# Buildings are currently simplistic, shapes and sizes are closer to real ones.

Idea is to use this a template to make visualization for people who hate maps, 

but would love interactive map or way to look around.
